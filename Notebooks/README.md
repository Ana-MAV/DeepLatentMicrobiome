`1_MAIN_DeepLatentMicrobiome` is the main notebook that summaries the capabilities of the Deep Latent Microbiome system.

The remaining notebooks could be divided into:

* autoencoder_results: summary of results of experiments for selection of hyperparameters

* reference_model_predictions_and_analysis: build selected reference model (experiment 351), run analysis about microbiome reconstruction and prediction in test set, and prediction in novel ecosystems

* model_reference_\*domainFeatures\*: relevant feature analysis

* model_aggregated_\*: microbiome prediction at different taxonomic levels

* model_transferLearning: transfer learning analysis
