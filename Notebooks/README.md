* **`MAIN_DeepLatentMicrobiome`** is the main notebook that summaries the capabilities of the Deep Latent Microbiome system.

* `reference_model_predictions_and_analysis` builds the selected reference model (experiment 351), runs the analysis about microbiome reconstruction and prediction in the test set, and makes prediction in novel ecosystems. It is the template notebook for further models to develop.

* `autoencoder_results` summaries the results of the experiments for selection of hyperparameters.
